For the first beta, we'll put a little work on you (sorry...) and you'll have to compile the whole SDK by yourself before you can get started. Don't worry: it's actually pretty easy and we've documented it step by step. In the end, the process is quite simple and should take only a few minutes to get things to start compiling (the actual compile time will take a bit longer...).

To get started with Minko 3 beta 2, just follow those tutorials:

-   [Installing the SDK sources](../tutorial/Installing_the_SDK_sources.md)
-   [Installing the SDK, Step 2: Setup your environment](../tutorial/Installing_the_SDK.md#Step_2:_Setup_your_environment) and all following steps
-   You then have to compile the SDK for each target:
    -   To target Windows, follow the [Compiling the SDK for Windows](../tutorial/Compiling_the_SDK_for_Windows.md) tutorial.
    -   To target OSX, follow the [Compiling the SDK for OSX](../tutorial/Compiling_the_SDK_for_OS_X.md) tutorial.
    -   To target Linux, follow the [Compiling the SDK for Linux](../tutorial/Compiling_the_SDK_for_Linux.md) tutorial.
    -   To target HTML5, follow the [Compiling the SDK for HTML5](../tutorial/Compiling_the_SDK_for_HTML5.md) tutorial.
    -   To target iOS, follow the [Compiling the SDK for iOS](../tutorial/Compiling_the_SDK_for_iOS.md) tutorial.
    -   To target Android, follow the [Compiling the SDK for Android](../tutorial/Compiling_the_SDK_for_Android.md) tutorial.
-   [Create a new application](../tutorial/Create_a_new_application.md)

If you need help, please post on the dedicated [support forum](http://minko.io/forums/forum/support/minko-engine/).

For the next release, we will provide a web installer with pre-compiled binaries for each project and each target.
